        "Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI models trained on vast text data to understand and generate human language. Models like GPT and BERT excel at tasks like translation, summarization, and sentiment analysis due to their deep learning techniques and large-scale training. Recently these models got popular with the rise of Open-AI's ChatGPT and their different models, showcasing the potential of these models in a lot of aspects of our current society.\n",
        "\n",
        "Open-source LLMs are cost-effective and customizable, with strong community support, but may underperform compared to paid models and require technical expertise to manage. Paid LLMs offer superior performance, ease of use, and regular updates, but are costly, less flexible, and create dependency on external providers for ongoing access and updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Open Source LLMs:\n",
        "In this lab we are going to use Ollama ([Ollama GitHub Link](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)), that is a library that let us use a long list of open-source LLMs of differing size. For this section we are going to be using **'llama3.2'** or **'llama3.2:1b'** for **text based tasks**, and **'llava-phi3'** for **multi-modal tasks** (e.g. image to text). Ollama has a great variety of models, and those can be found here: [model library](https://ollama.com/library). You are free to explore them if you want to try using them, you can check the advantages and disadvantages of each.\n",
        "\n",
        "Or they can also be observed in here:\n",
        "\n",
        "![pic10.png](https://github.com/didiersalazar/DM2024-Lab2-Master/blob/main/pics/pic10.png?raw=true)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous image we can observe that all LLMs have something called parameters, these are the internal weights that the model learns during training, helping it understand and generate language. The more a model has, the more complex and accurate it can be, but it also needs more memory to run.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Models with **7 billion parameters** need at least **8 GB of VRAM**.\n",
        "**13 billion parameters** require **16 GB of VRAM**.\n",
        "**33 billion parameters** need **32 GB of VRAM**.\n",
        "The higher the number of parameters, the more memory and computational power the model needs to function efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "And so that is why we are trying to use small LLMs for this practice, because they require a lot of computational resources, so by using 'llama3.2' and 'llava-phi3', both models with 3 billion parameters, we will only use at most 8 GB of VRAM. But if there are some issues with 'llama3.2' we can still use 'llama3.2:1b' the model with 1 billion parameters that requires less resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "So now let's talk about the models:\n",
        "**LLaMA 3.2** is part of the LLaMA series (Large Language Model Meta AI), designed to provide efficient language understanding and generation. Despite having fewer parameters than some larger models, it offers strong performance in NLP tasks, making it suitable for scenarios where both accuracy and resource efficiency are important.\n",
        "\n",
        "**LLaVA** (Large Language and Vision Assistant) models, like **LLaVA-Phi3** are multimodal models combining language and vision capabilities. It can interpret visual inputs like images and generate corresponding text, making it ideal for tasks that require both visual understanding and language generation, such as image captioning and answering visual-based questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**I will be using the llama3.2 model going onwards, you can change it for the smallest version if it is necessary for you, or you can try to run it on Kaggle where you can use online GPU resources for it.**"

        "LLM embeddings are dense vector representations of text generated by Large Language Models. These embeddings, like we have already seen in the lab, capture the semantic meaning and relationships between words, phrases, or even entire documents by mapping them into a high-dimensional space where similar pieces of text are placed closer together. What makes LLM embeddings special is that they are contextual and rich in meaning, meaning the same word can have different embeddings based on its surrounding context.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, the word **\"bank\"** would have different embeddings in the sentences **\"I sat by the river bank\"** and **\"I deposited money in the bank.\"** This ability to understand and encode context enables LLM embeddings to outperform traditional techniques (like TF-IDF or one-hot encoding) by providing a deeper, more nuanced representation of language.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, LLM embeddings are pre-trained on vast amounts of data, allowing them to generalize well across different tasks (like classification, clustering, or similarity detection) without the need for extensive retraining. This makes them highly valuable in many natural language processing tasks today.\n",

        "Few-shot prompting classification for LLMs involves giving the model a few labeled examples (typically 5 or fewer) within a prompt to guide it in performing a classification task. Instead of needing extensive training, the LLM uses these examples to understand the task and classify new inputs. This approach is significant in current research because it allows LLMs to perform well on tasks with minimal labeled data, reducing the need for large training datasets and making it highly flexible for various NLP tasks, including those in low-resource languages or niche domains.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab exercise, we will explore zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot prompting for classification using an LLM:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Zero-shot means the model performs classification without seeing any examples beforehand.\n",
        "- 1-shot provides the model with just one labeled example per class to guide its classification.\n",
        "- 5-shot gives the model five labeled examples per class to improve its understanding of the task.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since processing large datasets can be computationally demanding, we will only sample 20 test texts per emotion for the classification task, allowing us to test the model's performance more efficiently without using the entire test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Process order: Explanation Prompt -> Examples + labels (if it is not zero-shot) -> Text to classify**\n",
        "\n",

In this case if the model does not follow the instructions we are retrying the same text until it outputs one of the accepted labels for it."

It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
